// VC Trader AI: agent_close_position (LIVE EXECUTE).
//
// Calls the workspace-scoped live-execute boundary as the workspace owner
// (PFM_AGENT_TOKEN) and returns the verbatim BFF response. The BFF gates the
// close against the owner's autonomous-unlock window SERVER-SIDE: if the window
// is open it accepts/executes the close; otherwise it returns 200 with
// execution_status 'downgraded' and writes NOTHING. The field is named
// downgraded_to_staged, but no staged card is created and none can be: the
// only staged-card route requires PROPOSE_ONLY + a staged_action, and this
// tool is EXECUTE / None (403 openclaw_tool_not_propose_only). The response
// carries accepted_queued / executed / downgraded_to_staged / lock_reason.
